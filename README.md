Book Comprasion Project Among Turkish Online Book Stores

What is benefits for people who buy books: 
If a person wants buy a book, generally they add more books to their list cause of free shipping after a price limit. Therefore, they just enter a reliable online
book store web-site and buy. I provide you to find your book-list-to-buy cheapest possible(your selected publisher) with this Python program.

My main purpose is doing web-scrapping and getting datas from reputable online book store web-sites(at least 5-10 sites) automatically and pairing same 
books-authors-publishers and comparing prices.

I made just first part of the project. I started with D&R Book Store.
You can search which book you want and the output will give you the searching results(same books but different publisher).
